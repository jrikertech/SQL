# SQL
Here are the SQL projects that I have finished or will continue working on
Welcome to my project-based SQL portfolio! 
This repository showcases my mastery of SQL and contains a wide range of projects that I have designed and completed. 
With this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in database management and analysis, while also providing a tangible record of my growth and development as a SQL professional.
Whether you are a recruiter or a fellow developer, I invite you to take a closer look at my work and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback. 
Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I look forward to connecting with you!
